<div class="sub-area"><div class="tags-area"> <span class="tags">Tags</span><div class="tags-box">Web Design</div></div><div class="btn back btn-splash">Back</div></div><h4>Task</h4><p> Create a one-page mobile first design website that would give the user some information about HairWolf and then include information about each of the products currently available from HairWolf. The information about each product had to be straight to the point and be made clear of what each product does and how to use it.</p><h4>Process</h4><p> This project took a few weeks to do with the client being unsure about what content they want the website to include and went from being a medium sized project down to a tiny project due to the client previously wanting to be able to independently add, edit and remove products and change different parts of the website which would have been done in Ruby on Rails. The client then wanted the website to instead just give information about the products rather than having an entire purchasing system so this is what changed the entire project to being very simple to make.</p><h4>Feedback</h4><p> The client was delighted about the design of the website and was very impressed with how the information was shown for each of the products.</p> <img src="assets/img/clients/hairwolf/tablet.jpg" alt="Hairwolf web page on tablet">
