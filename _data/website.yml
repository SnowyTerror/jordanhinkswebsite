header-title: Hey I'm Jordan!
header-blurb: I am an English <span>photographer</span> who loves <span>graphic</span> & <span>web design</span>; aesthetically beautiful and vivid creations are my trade!

about: As you know already I am Jordan and I like to take photos and design thinks such as this website which was all hand coded, however, some things that you may not know about me is that while I design websites I also like to design other things too such as graphics for people such as Twitch Streamers, YouTubers or even for people who want golf invitations or anything really. I like to also experiment with new and crazy ways of doing things such as a different way to show content or do things in general and to make things seem complex but are quite easy.
<br><br>
In my spare time, I like to play games to chill just like anyone would do &amp; fix computers or any other devices that are thrown my way... WOW not literally, I would mainly be the software type with improving performance and getting rid of those annoying viruses but I would also fix hardware problems such as faulty screens or CD drives if anyone uses those anymore.
<br><br>
One key thing you got to remember though is that if you want me to design a website for you then let me do what I'm good at and you won't end up with a shitty site, and that's putting it nicely.
