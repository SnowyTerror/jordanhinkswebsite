    The client requested that the logo looked professional and essentially use gold colors to make the logo stand out, some brainstorming ideas were thrown about such as the idea that made it into the final version which was the diamond. This logo went through multiple revisions as shown below which also included trying an entirely different design concept. The cover page didn't require as much time or brainstorming because the services offered were predetermined and used the same theme as the logo by using gold and white together on a dark background.
