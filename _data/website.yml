header-title: Hey I'm Jordan!
header-blurb: I am an English <span>photographer</span> who loves <span>graphic</span> & <span>web design</span>; aesthetically beautiful and vivid creations are my trade!

about: As you know already I'm Jordan and that I like to design websites along with taking photos, but some things that you may also want to know is that I'm not a talkative person, but doesn't mean I am not a listener. I prefer to listen to what others have to say and then give my point on the matter and throw ideas around. I like to experiment with new ways of doing things as to how I can show content within a web page or to represent a brand using complex looking techniques but are simple.

        In my spare time, I like to play video games as a way to chill out and get my mind away from thinking of new ideas. I also fix computers with my spare time when it's available and this would be software and a little bit of hardware, one time I was asked to fix a laptop with the problem that all the USB ports wouldn't work and the guy needed it for the next night, I stayed up for 4 hours trying to fix that thing and I was determined to not give up, guess what I did... I didn't give up. Hope you liked that wee story.
