<h4 class="sub-header">Task</h3>
<p>
  Design a logo to use as a brand name to be displayed on things such as Facebook to make it easy for their clients to identify them. A Facebook cover image also had to be designed to give information about what services they offer across all devices using the Facebook platform.
</p>

<h4 class="sub-header">Process</h3>
<p>
  The client requested that the logo looked professional and essentially use gold colors to make the logo stand out, some brainstorming ideas were noted such as the idea that made it into the final version which was the diamond. This logo went through multiple revisions as shown below which also included trying an entirely different design concept. The cover page didn't require as much time or brainstorming because the services offered were predetermined and used the same theme as the logo by using gold and white together on a dark background.

  The client was delighted with the final design and couldn't wait for it to go live on their Facebook page along with liking the detail put into the car illustration that felt sold it.
