<h4 class="sub-header">Task</h3>
<p>
  Design a logo that would relate to the name of the brand in a simplistic manner while keeping the color theme of green and a complimentary offset color.
</p>

<h4 class="sub-header">Process</h3>
<p>
  The client allowed the freedom of creativity granted that the colors were used and represented the name, this took 3 different attempts to get to the final design while keeping the same basic concepts such as the controller to represent the gaming aspect and the arrow which would represent respawning. The client felt that an entirely green design would look best for this.
</p>

<h4 class="sub-header">Feedback</h3>
<p>
  The client was very pleased with the outcome of this design and felt that the logo truly represents what they do and that the logo gives them much more flexibility with its simplistic and complementary colors, especially when placed onto their website that had a white background.
