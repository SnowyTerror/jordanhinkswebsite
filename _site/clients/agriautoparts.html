  <h3>Task</h3>
  <p>
    Design a timeless simplistic logo that would relate to the company and design an invoice document that would have a modern design to it and would look very tidy and would allow for the information that would later be put onto the invoices to be clearly understandable by splitting the information into distinct columns. The contact information and sponsors had to be clearly readable on the invoice but not disturb the content that would be later put onto the invoice sheets as well to make sure that it doesn't clash with the information that would later be put onto the invoices.

    I spent a lot of time with the client that approached me with the opportunity to ensure that everything is how they wanted it. The process of this job was great as I was given the freedom to design it whatever way I wanted as long as the essential things were included such as the name of the company, contact information, sponsors and the column information that would build up the barebones of both the logo and the invoice. This didn't require any overhaul designs on my part as the client was happy with the first design mockups and was improved upon to make it look tidy and fluid like.

    The client was happy with the design and was impressed by the amount suggestions was given from me as to why certain things wouldn't work and how other methods could be used to not only display certain pieces of content on the invoice but to also make other content look much better by doing so.
