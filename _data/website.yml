# About
about-me: As you know already I am Jordan and I like to take photos and design things such as this website which was all hand coded, however, some things that you may not know about me is that while I design websites I also like to design graphics for people such as Twitch Streamers, YouTubers or even for people who want golf invitations or anything really. I like to also experiment with new and crazy ways of doing things such as a different way to show content or do things in general and to make things seem complex but are quite easy.<br><br> In my spare time, I like to play games to chill just like anyone would do & fix computers or any other devices that are thrown my way... WOW not literally, I would mainly be the software type with improving performance and getting rid of those annoying viruses but I would also fix hardware problems such as faulty screens or CD drives if anyone uses those anymore.
