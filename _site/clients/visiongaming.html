    To create a multiple page website that would include features and information about the community and the game server along with having an application form that would allow users to apply and have the data be sent to an email of the clients choosing. The design of the website had to look neat and easy to navigate with content being clearly readable across all devices such as desktop computers all the way to phones, the website had to include similarities to make users feel right at home with the website by using some personal additions such as the font being the same and content being very obvious to make it clear with content that would be on the website.

    I found most of the process straight forward with styling to the website being a new type of design to make and went through multiple revisions of the website to make it perfect as to what would look and function well along with ensuring the client would also like it. The only thing I found difficult was the application form which had to send the data to an email and making sure that the data that the user would input was properly validated to prevent spam and keep the data secure, the second piece I found very difficult but overcome was using PHP to give each user a unique code that they could use but would not be given to anyone else.

    Overall the client was happy with the outcome of the design, with the client's basic knowledge of the code structure it made it easy to add or remove content when needed and preferred it this way as it kept the website lightweight for faster load times.
