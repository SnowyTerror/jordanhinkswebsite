            <h2>How I Started Graphics Design</h2>
            <p>
              I first began graphics design during my secondary school years; I saw potential in creating websites that were aesthetically beautiful and professionally optimised. I enjoyed toying with numerous graphical tools such as Adobe PhotoShop and Adobe Illustrator, devising website concepts and bringing them to life using HTML and CSS.

            <h2>My Work Ethic</h2>
            <p>
              I understand the importance of effective communication - I strive to meet the targets and visual goals set out by the client while also offering professional and helpful advice concerning the projectâ€™s direction and final format. Using this method, it is hoped that a more efficient and impressive project may be created.
