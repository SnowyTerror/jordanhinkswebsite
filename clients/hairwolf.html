    This website was focused towards promoting and providing more information about the hair products being sold, for this site it needed to be straightforward and to the point with a simple approach and the client had a rough idea of what they wanted.
    <br><br>
    So what I did was a 1-page layout that would contain all the information in a neatly spaced format. The site had to look professional while also making the content readable.
    <br><br>
    I needed a way of making the products look neat and expandable in the way of adding more products in the future so I went for a card style format where the information for each product would be contained within the card and when someone wanted more information on a product they could click a button that would move the overview details out and more detailed information in.
    <br><br>
    Overall this site went through many different versions of a light design to the dark but stylized design. The client really wanted a mobile-friendly design which reflected on how the overall design was made to be simple
