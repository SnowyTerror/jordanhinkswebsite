            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Plagiarism</h2>

            <p>
              Plagiarism is when someone takes someone else’s work and claims it as their own and doesn’t give credit to the person that originally wrote it and essentially is another word for copying or stealing someone else’s work and and trying to pass is off as their own. If they do this and it is discovered there could be serious consequences that will be later discussed in this blog.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Avoiding Plagiarism</h2>
            
            <p>
              To avoid plagiarism in terms of using someone else’s work is to just not use it or if feel it will benefit in a topic you are writing about or research that you are carrying out then credit the creator by clearly stating that it’s someone else’s work and this is done by showing their full name and where you took the work from such as a website by giving a link to the page it came from. A common system to use is the harvard referencing system that has a format of how you should credit the creator and what is important to mention in the bibliography. If someone has plagiarised your work without crediting and you’re not happy about the situation the first thing to usually do is contact them asking that they give you credit for your work that they have used in theirs, if however they don’t do what you ask of them then you could take it further depending on how unique your work is especially if you have copyrighted your work and take them to court or you could just make the public aware that the plagiarizer is claiming your work and essentially public shame them.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Plagiarism Software</h2>
            
            <p>
              Plagiarism software has become much better by using algorithms that are able to compare it to pre-existing work from books to pages on the internet and there are free online tools that you could use to check to see how much of your work or someone else’s work is plagiarized and this is commonly used within education to check if students are actually writing the work themselves instead of taking it straight from somewhere such as a webpage as it has become more common for students to do. How plagiarism software works for education is by comparing it against work that previous students have submitted and also against tons of websites to check to see what percentage of work could potentially be plagiarized, if the system finds that 15% or more matches with something such as a website article then it will flag the students work and a teacher would then have to review the student's work and if the teacher sees it as plagiarized then the student could be in a big problem especially if they are studying university subjects and big consequences will happen due to the situation. An example of a free plagiarism checking tool is <a href="http://smallseotools.com/plagiarism-checker" target="_blank">smallseotools.com</a> it only allows a limit of 1000 words so it isn’t quite the tool to throw your entire document at however it shows the potential power of how complete plagiarism tools work.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Consequences of performing plagiarism</h2>
            
            <p>
              If you were to plagiarize someone’s work the consequences can vary a lot depending on what you plagiarize and what you have plagiarized for such as for a blog to give information to people or university so that you can pass your course. For this example we will be using the consequences that you will receive at university level as it is taken very seriously and have serious consequences such as the following;
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Kicked from the course</li>
              <li>2 year blacklist from university</li>
              <li>Student &amp; Job related Reputation destroyed</li>
              <li>Legal action</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Getting kicked from the course will seriously affect your career long term because a record will go with your name when you try to apply for a course or try and get an interview for a job. Even after the 2 year blacklist from the university is over it will be difficult for you to try and apply for the course or any other course that has the same level of difficulty. With your reputation being vandalised by yourself you will find it difficult in getting other students and/or employees to trust you with work they have produced and thus your reputation would be destroyed for properly copying as little as one sentence that you didn’t reference. If you were to plagiarize someone’s work such as a medicine or something that someone worked on and really feel you should be taught a lesson then they could potentially take legal action against you and thus will not only damage your reputation or take up time that could be better spent doing something else but it could cost a lot of money as the person’s work you plagiarized could sue you for a large amount of money thus leaving you with a broke reputation and a great loss of money.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> What is referencing</h2>
            
            <p>
              Referencing is the method that is used to display sources that have been used to help when completing a piece of work. This can be through citing quotes throughout a piece of work. This will show where you have taken a piece of information from. It can also be through the inclusion of a list known as a bibliography. A bibliography is a list of sources that have been used to assist you when you are completing an assignment or anything that you are working on. A bibliography will usually be placed at the end of a piece of work, this is important to be included in any piece of work that the internet is used for so that the assessor can see the sources you have used clearly and show you are not claiming that all of the information as your own as you have referenced everything that has helped you to explain the different points on the work. If you include someone else’s work within your own and don’t reference your source for that information or correctly format it you could potentially be accused for plagiarism.

            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> What is Harvard Referencing?</h2>
            
            <p>
              Harvard Referencing is a method of referencing the sources that have been used to complete a piece of work. They will usually use the author’s name and date of publication within the referencing and there are different formats for how you should reference a piece of work depending on what it is such as a website, book or journal. The references using this method will be listed at the end of the work to indicate to your lecturer or to who reviews your work that you have listed sources that you have used within your research and the Harvard referencing format makes it easy for them to understand who the Author is, when you found this information and where you found it from. This method will be listed in alphabetical order by the author’s name.

            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> How To reference</h2>
            
            <p>
              Referencing is important when writing an essay or any other form of written work. This is because a number of sources may be used to help with the completion of the work. So this section will help with how each of the different types of sources can be sourced within the bibliography that could be placed at the end of the work. This will show that you know how to properly reference the material used to help you with the work that is being created.
              
              <br><br>
              
              The sources that you could reference within the bibliography of a piece of work can include;
              
              <ul>
                <li>Books</li>
                <li>Journal Articles</li>
                <li>E-Journal Articles</li>
                <li>Newspaper Articles</li>

            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Books</h2>
            
            <p>
              To reference a book within a piece of work there are multiple pieces of information that should be considered. This includes Author’s name, Date of publication, Title, Subtitle and even the edition. The author’s name will be given surname first then initial. The date of publication will be given in round brackets. The title will be in italics. The edition is given when it is not the first edition.

              This applies to only one author of a book.
              If there were two authors then both author’s names will be referenced followed by the year, title and publisher. When referencing a book that has three authors all will be listed then the year of publication, the title and the publisher. The order of the authors will be listed in the order they are on the title page. However if there are four or more authors the first author will be listed followed by et al. This means and others so that it is clear there are four or more authors.

            <p>
              If a Newspaper article is used to help with a piece of work this should be referenced within the bibliography at the end of the piece of work. Included in a reference for a newspaper article would be the author of the articles name which will be given by surname and then initial. The year of publication will then be given in round brackets. The title of the article given in single quotation marks. Then the title of the newspaper will be given in italics and the first letter in the name will be capitalised. The edition if required will be given in round brackets. The day and month of the newspaper will also be included. The page number or numbers that the article covers will also be included within the reference.

              However if the author’s name is not given then the reference should include the title of the newspaper. This should be in italics and have the first letter of each word in capitals. Then the year of publication should be shown in round brackets. Then the title of the article should be displayed in single quotation marks. The day and month should be shown as well as the page reference.

              The reference for online newspapers if they have been used should include the author’s
              name with the surname first and then their initial. Then the year of publication should be
              displayed in round brackets. The title of the article should be shown next and it should be in single quotation marks. The title of the Newspaper should then be displayed in italics with the first letter of each word in Capitals. Then the day and month should be included within the reference.

              Another form of referencing that can be used is within the internet. This is because any website that is used to assist with a piece of work should be included within  the bibliography. This is important because this will show that you are clearly referencing the areas that have assisted you in completing a piece of work. There are a number of different ways that websites can be referenced.

              When referencing a website that has an individual author the content of the reference should be the author’s name and initials if they are available and they should be in capitals. The name will be surname first followed by initials. The year that the site was published or last updated should be included also. This will be included if it is available. The title of the website should be included in underlined or in italics. The URL should be included and finally the date that the site was accessed should also be included within the reference for the website.

            <p>
              When referencing organisations as others of the webpages you reference the same way that you would for an author the only difference is that the organisation behind the website would be referenced at the start because they have created the website and not by any one author.

            <p>
              Referencing a webpage that does not have an author, title or date would contain most of the information included in a reference for an authored website. The only difference would be with a website with no author the first piece of information would be the website name. If it had no title then this would be left out and the link and date would be the only parts shown on that reference. If the website date is unavailable then the only item missing from the reference would be the date.

            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> How to use Harvard Referencing</h2>
            
            <p>
              The Harvard method of referencing lists the references by the author’s name and the date of publication for the reference. They are listed at the end of a piece of work in the bibliography. They are placed in the bibliography in alphabetical order by the author’s name. You can also use in text citation to use direct quotes within the main piece of the writing. This means that you would be able to improve the quality of your piece of work because you have used quotes to back up what you are saying at different points. Within the Harvard referencing system all information that is necessary should be included so that the reference could be found again. They layout of the references should be consistent. If this is used in this way then it will help to prevent the chances of plagiarism because the referencing will be clear within a piece of work and will show that you have worked to show anything that you use that isn’t your own piece of work then the citation and references are shown clearly within the work completed.

            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Writing for Different Audiences and Purposes</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction </h3>
            
            <p>
              In this document we are talking about all the different types of writing styles and the purpose for them. There are different types of writing styles and they are Technical writing,  Reflective writing &amp; Academic writing.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Technical Writing</h3>
            
            <p>
              Completing technical writing will have the outcome that the information included within it is relevant and will be useful as well as being accurate and will be specifically geared towards a specific target audience. Examples of technical writing would be fire evacuation procedures and health and safety guidelines. These would be examples of technical writing because the information should be clear so that the audience will know clearly what to do in the event of a fire and where their assembly point would be located and how to get there. This form of writing could be used so that employees would be aware of how to stay safe when in the workplace so that they can comply with the health and safety guidelines that a country’s government puts in place to ensure everyone’s safety when they are within the workplace.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Tips for good technical writing would be;</h3>
            
            <p>
              Know who your audience is. So if someone is new to using something or a piece of software or even in a new workplace every detail must be given for them so that they will be able to understand clearly what they are to do and what the software they may be using does. It will also mean that they are aware of the procedures that a company has in regards to health and safety and their fire safety protocols. The writing should be straight to the point so the audience knows clearly what is being said. You should know how to research. Gather the information that you are using from a number of sources and ensure that you understand it so that you are able to analyse it thoroughly. Then once you understand it place it so that others will be able to read and understand what is being said easily.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Reflective Writing</h3>
            
            <p>
              Reflective writing is when you take something such as an event or achievement and look back on it by writing about it to effectively evaluate it. This consists of choosing a past tense memory such as winning a football much for your local club and then express of what you did and if a decision you made was a good thing or if you could have done better if you didn’t make that decision. So for example you could have passed the ball to a teammate that didn’t manage to score a goal from it and with that you could feel that if you were to keep the ball and either attempt to score the goal yourself or pass it to a different teammate then you could have had a better experience. If the match was lost could reflect on what could be done differently Some examples of where this type of writing would be done is in a diary or a journal where you would write of what is on your mind and will then later give you that chance to look back and learn from what you previously did.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Academic Writing</h3>
            
            <p>
              Academic writing is an important way to keep your writing clear and concise and make sure that you write ideas in a comprehensible form. It’s clear expression of these ideas that may impress your tutor. In academic writing it is most important rule to follow would be punctuation and grammar as the work that you have produced will need to be readable and the words would need to be the correct spelling. It is used in many educational ways such as textbooks an example would be a science book as it teaches you about biology, chemistry and physics along with showing the periodic table this way the tutors teaching science would hand out the books as it will help you more as you are reading the different subjects and also following in the book of what the tutor is talking about. It can be also used within a dissertation this is when you do a massive report that someone would do as a final year project, the expectation is that the learner would take responsibility for their own learning and that the learner would also produce a literature review.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Blogging</h2>
            
            <p>
              Blogging is a form of writing that is carried out on the internet. The main purpose of a blog is to provide people with information on a certain topic. Within a blog a number of different media can be included and these include images and videos. These can help people to learn about different topics. This could include how to use a piece of software. Someone who may use this type of blog may rather view tutorials to help them to learn how to carry out different things within the piece of software. These will can either be informal or formal depending on what the blog is being used for.This means that if the blog was to be used for tutorials of how to use a piece of software the mood would be formal because the person is using the blog to help them to understand more about how to use a piece of software. If the blog was to be used to keep track of your activities in everyday life for your friends to see then the information would be more informal. Examples of different blogging sites would include blogger and WordPress.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Use of Email</h2>
            
            <p>
              Another form of writing for an audience would be within email. This would be writing for an audience because you are writing the email to send to another person. This could include writing for a teacher or writing a email to a peer. This would be a form of writing for two different audiences because the tone of the email would change between the two. This is because an email to a teacher or lecturer would be much more formal because you are asking them for assistance with something or you are asking their permission to use something. So you would use much more formal language and would refer to them as MR/MRS or MISS. This would show respect to them from you. This is because this is a formal communication and would be inappropriate to use their first name. Writing an email to a peer would be writing for a different audience because you would use much more informal language because you would know each other so you would use much more informal language than sending one to a teacher. So you would be able to speak more casually to each other. So email can be used to write to different audiences.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Professionalism</h2>
            
            <p>
              Professionalism is a term used to describe someone who is more experienced than others in a job or subject and should have all of the following to be one of the best at their job or subject and it could also relate to how business operates with regards to their employees and their clients.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Communication Skill</h3>
            
            <p>
              Being able to clearly talk to others or get a message across clearly so that the person or group you are talking to clearly understands you and thus will also tell that person or group that you are easy to understand and communicate with which will benefit for being able to suggest an idea with a clear motive of saying what your idea is, what it can do and most importantly of how it can benefit them as that is the core purpose people really care about.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Building Relationships
</h3>
            
            <p>
              Having a relationship with a co-worker or your boss can benefit greatly as it gives them a little insight about you and you can get some information on them but this can also help long term for example if you need extra time in completing a task for your boss you could leverage that so you could get that extra time and it also means that since you and your boss are friends they will be much more willing to listen to you and take your idea on, if your boss needs to let people go it also makes it much more difficult for them to do so as they could have an attachment to you and as for co-workers it means that you would be able to get them to help you out sometimes to say for example do a task for you.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Decision Making</h3>
            
            <p>
              This can be a huge factor to get exactly what you want or to reach a goal you desire and doesn’t have any right or wrong answer but instead is just seen as a possible mistake you could make to delay your goals. For example if you’re looking for a job and you eventually find something that will benefit you and you are given an opportunity of an interview, then you will have to prove to the company of what you can offer to them such as your knowledge/expertise in a certain topic/subject. Making decisions that benefit a company short term can sometimes also benefit you long term which is the ideal goal to naturally try and benefit yourself as much as possible.
              
              <br><br>
              
              An example of this would be applying to be a web designer in a company, they offer an interview and could ask of how you would benefit their company. The company would naturally choose a person for the job that has a substantial amount of experience with professional software such as Photoshop, Illustrator and coding pages because that will save them money and time as they won’t have to train that person up or have to pay someone else to create a page if that person knows how to do it already.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            
            <p>
              This can be the single most important thing for a team as every team will need a leader to be able to give people within the team roles of what each person has to do and can also be motivational towards the team to then also make the team feel better about something and can also make a team pull through something that would otherwise be seen as impossible. Some of the traits that make a leader are being able to be bossy, quick thinker, motivational & take responsibility. It doesn't take much to be a leader but it takes a lot to be a good leader and it makes a huge difference they act like a second set of eyes for each of the members in the team and to be able to give clear feedback good or bad and to try and make each member learn from the mistakes.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Advocating and Negotiating for yourself and your causes</h3>
            
            <p>
              Being able to advocate and negotiate (essentially bargaining) is a great skill to have as it means being able to try get extra of something or the same thing for a cheaper price or as what lawyers do for those convicted for crimes to get reduced sentences or a nicer cell. Everyone has at least tried to bargain once and it's always good to at least try as you might be able to get a discount on something such as a book or piece of furniture and the factors it will be determined down to it being a successful bargain or not would be if the person you are bargaining with is feeling kind/good that day, what language you use with persuasion being a frequent customer and your looks essentially as it is common that people can get discounts based by their looks. Being able to bargain doesn’t always have to necessarily benefit you directly but you can instead do it on behalf of employees you work with to get your wages raised or you could be doing it on behalf of the company you work at to get something such as delivery charges reduced or supplies to make the a product.
              
              <br><br>
              
              An example of bargaining(negotiating) would be you trying to purchase a phone from someone that priced as £100, you could then convince them to lower it by pointing out all that is wrong with the phone such as it may be a little damaged and will have to mean you’ll have to spend more money to fix it and thus making them feel bad for you as you’ll have to spend extra money to get it fixed. Some methods that people have also tried is to be sweet with the seller and this method would commonly work with older people to be very nice to them and they could turn around and say they’ll just give it to you for a lower amount of money.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Career Planning and Management</h3>
            
            <p>
              Taking control of your career life is important as you have to know exactly what you want you will enjoy and what you want to be remembered as but to do that you’ll have to make the decision to chase that until you get it.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Work Life Balance</h3>
            
            <p>
              Balancing your work with your life is a difficult thing to do sometimes as you may want to be getting somewhere in your work in regards to a position that you can feel proud of but at the same time you have to socialize or do what you do in your free time and its a matter of finding the sweet spot of being able to have these run alongside each other without being put under stress. This is more commonly being seen with working single mums as they have to take care of their child/children but at the same time have to work to support them.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Bounty Enforcement</h3>
            
            <p>
              Boundaries are basically where you say “this is something I will not do or this is a line I will not cross”, its just a method of limiting yourself in certain areas to in some cases protect yourself and can either be a benefit or an opportunity killer. Some examples of basic boundaries that would happen in the workplace would be thinks such as not dating fellow employees as it is seen as non-professional. Boundaries would also be set for your personal life such as you’ll not go out drinking a day or two days before work or make sure that you eat breakfast before you leave no matter the situation even though you could potentially get a snack on the way to work.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Professional Bodies</h2>
            
            <p>
              Professional Bodies or institutions have a more professional code of conduct or protocols that any members must follow and live by these code of conducts 
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>The code of Ethics maintains that everyone must:</h3>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Place the integrity of the professional and the and the clients above your own interests</li>

            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h3>The Standards of Professional Conduct cover:</h3>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Duties to clients and employers must be completed</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="subheader"><span>---</span> Codes of Conduct and Practice</h2>
            
            <p>
              Code of conducts and practice are the professional legal guidelines that must be followed in regards to different things. An example of one of the policies and codes of conduct would be the SRC acceptable use policy for IT. This is the document that is used within the SRC that students sign which means that they agree to use the internet in an appropriate way when they are logging on to it through their college username. This document sets out the responsibility that you have when you are logging onto the computers within the college to only use the internet for an appropriate to help them to complete a piece of work that they are completing.

            <p>
              Another policy that the SRC has is a Social Media Policy. This sets out guidelines in relation to the use of Social media. This includes that they highlight how social media sites are public and they highlight how you should be careful and think about what you are posting. This is because anyone is able to read the information. What you post may get you into trouble if you post something that may be seen as offensive. This can include any slanderous comments about anyone. So the policy highlights how you should be careful what you are posting online. The individual is liable for what they post so they should always think about what they are posting before they do. It also states how they should be respectful of other people and not post about them on social media because this could have a profound effect on the other person.

            <p>
              Even the Ulster University has policies that they follow which include an equal opportunities policy and a policy on bullying and harassment. Their policy on equal opportunities refers to a number of ways that would include;
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>'Gender'</li>
              <li>'Marital Status'</li>
              <li>'Having or not having dependents'</li>
              <li>'Religious Belief or political opinion'</li>
              <li>'Race'</li>
              <li>'Disability'</li>
              <li>'Sexual Orientation'</li>
              <li>'Age'</li>
              <li>'Socio-economic background'</li>
              <li>'Trade union membership'</li>
              <li>'Employment status'</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              This policy means that everyone will have the same opportunity to receive an equal education no matter what type of situation they are currently in. This also means that the university will provide everyone with the same opportunities. It also states how everyone will be treated with respect at this university. It also states how a breach in this policy could result in disciplinary action.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            
            <p>
              Another Policy that Ulster University have is in relation to the prevention of bullying and harassment. This means that they are responsible to ensure that no one is being treated unfairly for any reason. So the university has a responsibility to ensure that no one is being bullied for any reason. It is their responsibility to stop any bullying that is taking place before it takes place or before it takes a much more serious turn. This will mean that they must ensure that they do not let bullying get out of hand. This will mean that more people will be able to get a full education within the university because there is a policy in place to help to prevent any bullying from being carried out.
