<p>This website was designed towards presenting the Actor's acting career along with expanding his fan face into his social media personality aspect and with this design I was quite limited to using Weebly's website builder rather than how I would mainly create the sites.
<br><br>
I had to take the existing pages as to what content he wanted to be included and work around that as to take out content that would no longer work with what he is aiming for and add new content that would boost attention to what he wanted his fan base to focus on or get the latest news about him. With the limited styling capabilities, some content was limited to being manipulated so this meant that some content would be where it wasn't supposed to when viewed on certain devices.
<br><br>
Some of the areas had to be completing redesigned in terms of its layout and was one of the features that had to be thought of on the spot to meet the deadline.
<br><br>
Overall the client was happy with the end result and understand that if another hosting was used then the end result would have been a lot better but I personally fell that this doesn't represent my full potential of designing and coding it up.</p>
