The client felt that an entirely green design would look best for this.</p><h4>Feedback</h4><p> The client was very pleased with the outcome of this design and felt that the logo truly represents what they do and that the logo gives them much more flexibility with its simplistic and complementary colors, especially when placed onto their website that had a white background.</p> <img src="assets/img/clients/gamingrespawn/logo.jpg" alt="Gaming Respawn logo"> <img src="assets/img/clients/gamingrespawn/card.jpg" alt="Gaming Respawn business card">
