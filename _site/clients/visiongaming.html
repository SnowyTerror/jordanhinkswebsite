    This website was a landing area for their users to find out information about the community and also view the features that are available on their game server. This was a medium sized site with multiple pages along with forms and the ability to add content when needed.
    <br><br>
    For this multi-page site, I had to go through a few designs that would not only look good in practice but also function well when used. The presentation of the content had to also fit with the game and so that the users would fell at home while using the site.
    <br><br>
    This site not only needed a redesign on how it looks but also of how it functions to make the content load much faster along with making it look great on all devices. The style of the design wanted by the client was a slick design for easy navigation and readability which were both meet. With this site, I had to style it back to front in a way as I had to style it mobile first then desktop last due to some of the visual glitches which I am actually glad happened because this allows me to rethink the styling previously done.
    <br><br>
    Overall the client was happy with the design and has basic knowledge of the code structure to easily add or remove content when needed, for me, the hardest part of the site was the forms that sent data to an email.
